It is home to a number of famous sea-life species, including a variety of birds, fish and dolphins (including bottlenose dolphins and humpback dolphins). There are also two species of whales during the whale season from June to November. Dolphins, and in particular the friendly bottlenose dolphins which are present throughout the year, have become a major tourist attraction. Tourists go out in fishing boats to see these dolphins, and often jump into the water to swim with them. Though friendly in nature, dolphins can sometimes be surrounded by up to 20 boats chasing after them, and this can cause them stress, particularly when they are feeding or nursing. Thus, the main focus of the African marine conservation project is to monitor the dolphins and human-dolphin interaction.<br>Which one of the following is NOT true regarding the dolphins? </h4>

	         		<h4>Up until recently, the village of Ramdegi was a bustling farming community in central India's famous Tiger Reserve. Today, the village's human population stands at exactly zero. As part of an on-going effort to reduce human conflict with wildlife, the Indian government has been encouraging communities living in and around nature reserves to relocate for the sake of peaceful coexistence. Last month, everyone in Ramdegi did just that: some 200 families agreed to accept incentive packages and move beyond the reserve's borders, freeing the land to be reclaimed by the surrounding biodiversity.<br>

                    A little over a month after the last human departed, Ramdegi is now home to herds of deer, antelope and boars - grazing on the meadows that were once cropland and cattle farms. Even a tiger has been spotted prowling the grounds of the empty village, free from dangerous and often deadly conflicts with humans that have driven the species to “endangered” status.<br>
